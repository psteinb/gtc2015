As shown in section \ref{sec:alg}, the application at hand relies heavily on 3D image stack convolutions with large kernels. In order to produce hypothesis on an efficient design of multi-view deconvolution, a benchmarks on FFT performance and 3D FFT based convolutions were conducted with artificial single precision data. All runs were performed under a \texttt{nvprof} in order to obtain the relevant statistics. Every data set containes 50 runs of the program.
